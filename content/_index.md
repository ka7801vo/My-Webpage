I've been inspired by some cool people to create my own website, mainly to be able to try writing some blogs. It would be cool if someone reads them, but I don't have high hopes for that. But if you do and have any feedback or want to chat about something, please reach out, for example by email! I enjoy talking to people about stuff I like, which I guess is quite normal.

One of the reasons I haven't created a website before is that I have a rather unmotivated disdain of everything relating to web development. But I finally did it when my friend recommended the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) framework and convinced me that I then would only have to write some extended markdown. Furthermore it is written in Rust, which is always a plus. You can for example read some thoughts I had on setting up the website in my [first blog post](./blog/introduction-blog).
